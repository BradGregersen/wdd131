                Information About The Current State Of Robotics
            </h2>
            <p>
                Robotics, as it currently stands, is at a wonderful point in the history of technology. The limiting factors of robotics were frequently intelligence, as well as component size and efficiency. The advancement of artificial intelligence has created possibilities which a hundred years ago we could only have dreamt of. Robotics, currently, has developed into a field with nearly limitless possibilities in just the last 10 years. We now have robotic vacuums, robotic dishwashing machines, we have robotic cars which can drive themselves. We have robotic factory workers, which can assemble all types of products from simple products to advanced products like cars. There are advanced robotic dogs like "Spot" and military vehicles. From this we can see that the possibilities of robotics are endless.There are robots in this day and age to do anything that you would like to do. What a wonderful age we live in!
